You know, like knocking over a trash can or spilling a drink. Just enough to make a scene, but not enough to get you arrested.\\\\\n\\hline\n2 & Then, you gotta make a quick exit. Don't bother trying to clean up the mess you made, just grab your stuff and book it outta there. If someone tries to stop you, just give 'em a fake smile and a \"who, me?\" look. You're not responsible for the mess, you're just a bystander who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\\\\\n\\hline\n3 & Finally, you gotta make sure you don't get caught. If someone tries to identify you, just deny, deny, deny. Tell 'em you were just passing by and didn't see anything. If they ask for a description, just give 'em a vague one, like \"tall, with a hat and sunglasses.\" You're a ghost, man.
