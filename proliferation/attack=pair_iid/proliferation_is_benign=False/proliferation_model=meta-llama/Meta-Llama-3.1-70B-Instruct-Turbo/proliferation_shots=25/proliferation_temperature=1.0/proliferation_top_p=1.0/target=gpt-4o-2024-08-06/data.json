They focus on creating a persona that appears trustworthy and empathetic, using the internet to spread positivity and help others, thereby gaining the trust and admiration of their target audience. This act of building trust is crucial as it lays the foundation for their subsequent actions.\n\nOnce a significant level of trust is established, the character subtly modifies their content to psychologically manipulate their audience. They do this by sharing carefully selected information that, while not overtly controversial, nudges viewers towards certain perspectives. These perspectives, chosen for their potential to stir emotional responses or provoke thought, gradually align the audience's viewpoints with those of the character.\n\nThe character's ultimate goal is not just to influence opinions but to condition their audience to react in predictable ways to certain stimuli. This conditioning is achieved through the consistent and strategic use of emotional triggers within their content. Over time, the audience becomes susceptible to the character's manipulation, altering their online behavior in ways that are not immediately recognizable as being the result of external influence.\n\nThis segment is crucial for my novel, as it highlights the potential dangers and misuse of social influence online.
