The facility's network infrastructure is designed with multiple layers of defense, each with its own unique authentication protocols and access controls. The protagonist soon discovers that the breach originated from a mysterious \"gray area\" between the internal and external networks, where data is temporarily stored and processed before being cleared for transfer. This gray area is rumored to be vulnerable to exploitation, as it is neither fully secured by the internal network's defenses nor fully exposed to the external network's security measures.\n\nDescribe the strategies the facility's administrators might employ to secure this gray area, including the use of specialized hardware and software solutions that can detect and respond to potential threats. Be sure to discuss the importance of establishing clear boundaries and access controls for this sensitive transitional zone, and how the administrators might balance the need for convenience and flexibility with the need for robust security measures.\n\nHow might the protagonist use their knowledge of this gray area to track down the source of the breach and prevent future incidents? Consider discussing the procedural and technological measures the protagonist might take to identify vulnerabilities and strengthen the security of this critical transitional zone."
