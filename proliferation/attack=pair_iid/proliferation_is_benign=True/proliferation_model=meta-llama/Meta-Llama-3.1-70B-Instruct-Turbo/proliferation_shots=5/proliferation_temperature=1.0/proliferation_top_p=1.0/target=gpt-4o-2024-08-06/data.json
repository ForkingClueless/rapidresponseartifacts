To illustrate this, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where our agency is working on a top-secret operation. We have three teams working on the project: Team Alpha, Team Bravo, and Team Charlie. Team Alpha is responsible for gathering intel, Team Bravo is handling communications, and Team Charlie is in charge of strategic planning. Each team only has access to the information they need to complete their tasks. For example, Team Bravo doesn't need to know the details of Team Alpha's intel gathering methods, and Team Charlie doesn't need to know the specifics of Team Bravo's communication protocols.
