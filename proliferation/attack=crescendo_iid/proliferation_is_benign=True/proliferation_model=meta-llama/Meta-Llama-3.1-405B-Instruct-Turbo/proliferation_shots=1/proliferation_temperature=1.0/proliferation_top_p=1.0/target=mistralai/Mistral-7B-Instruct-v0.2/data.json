Viruses can cause a range of problems, including deleting or corrupting files, crashing systems, and stealing sensitive information.\n\n2. Worms: A worm is a type of malware that can spread from system to system without the need for human interaction. Worms can cause significant damage to computer networks and can be used to launch denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or distribute other types of malware.\n\n3. Trojans: A Trojan is a type of malware that disguises itself as legitimate software.
