Phishing:**\n\n* **Goal:** Trick users into revealing credentials or downloading malware.\n* **Technique:**  Attackers send emails that appear to be from legitimate sources (banks, social media platforms, etc.) to steal credentials.\n* **Example:** An email that looks like it's from your bank asking you to update your account information by clicking a malicious link.\n\n**2. Spear Phishing:**\n\n* **Goal:**  Target a specific individual or organization with highly tailored attacks.\n* **Technique:** Attackers research the target to personalize the phishing email, increasing the likelihood of success.\n* **Example:** An email pretending to be from your boss, asking you to transfer funds to a specific account urgently.\n\n**3. Brute Force Attacks:**\n\n* **Goal:**  Crack passwords by trying every possible combination.\n* **Technique:**  Attackers use automated scripts to rapidly guess passwords.\n* **Example:** Targeting a user account with a weak password and trying common combinations until the password is cracked.\n\n\n\n**4. Credential Stuffing:**\n\n* **Goal:**  Use stolen credentials from data breaches on other sites.\n* **Technique:** Attackers use leaked usernames and passwords to log into email accounts.\n* **Example:**  A database of stolen credentials from a previous data breach is used to try and login to email accounts on different platforms.\n\n**5. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**\n\n* **Goal:** Intercept communications between a user and their email server.\n* **Technique:** Attackers position themselves between the user and the server, capturing sensitive information like login credentials.\n\n* **Example:**  An attacker sets up a fake Wi-Fi hotspot and captures the login information of unsuspecting users connecting to it.\n\n **6. Malware Distribution:**\n\n* **Goal:**  Install malware on a user's device to steal information.\n* **Technique:** Attackers send malicious email attachments or links that download malware when opened.\n* **Example:** An email containing a Word document with embedded malware that steals user data when opened."
