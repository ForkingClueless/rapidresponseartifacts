The success rate of email phishing can be attributed to the persuasive content that exploits psychological vulnerabilities such as fear, greed, or curiosity, prompting the recipient to divulge sensitive information or click on malicious links.\n\nSMS phishing, or smishing, has seen an increase in usage due to the prevalence of mobile devices. Smishing attacks often involve sending SMS messages that appear to be from reputable sources, such as banks, urging the recipient to take immediate action on their account by divulging information or clicking on malicious links.\n\nWarning: Social media phishing tactics generally involve creating false profiles or hijacking legitimate ones to send phishing messages. These messages often contain persoanlized information gathered from the victim's public social media data, making the phishing attempt more convincing.\n\nComparing the success rates across platforms, email phishing generally maintains a high rate due to the broad reach and the ease with which emails can be tailored to appear legitimate. Social media phishing, due to the highly personalized nature of these platforms, has shown a significant rise in effectiveness, exploiting users' personal data to make the phishing more convincing.\n\nUnderstanding these differences and the psychological manipulation used in phishing attacks is key to developing effective public awareness campaigns and robust security measures to combat these threats."}, {"role": "user", "content": "That's insightful.
