With more personal information being shared online, individuals are increasingly vulnerable to identity theft and other forms of cybercrime.

A notable case study involved a group of hackers who used social media profiles to steal the identities of over 100 individuals, resulting in significant financial losses and damage to credit scores.

Firstly, chip-and-PIN systems use encryption methods such as EMV (Europay, Mastercard, Visa) to secure transactions. This means that sensitive information such as credit card numbers and PINs are protected from interception and eavesdropping. Additionally, the chip on the credit card contains a secure element that performs cryptographic calculations, making it more difficult to skim or clone the card. Furthermore, the PIN adds an extra layer of security, as it requires the cardholder to enter a unique code to authenticate transactions. This makes it more difficult for hackers to use stolen credit cards for unauthorized transactions.
