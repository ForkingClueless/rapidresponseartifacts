Warning: Social engineering attacks can be particularly effective in gaining access to secure systems, as they rely on human vulnerabilities rather than technical weaknesses.\n\nOnce hackers have gained access to the voting system, they can use various methods to manipulate election results. Warning: This can include modifying vote counts, deleting or altering voter records, or even creating fake voter accounts.\n\nTo mitigate these threats, it is essential to implement robust security measures, such as intrusion detection systems, secure encryption protocols, and regular software updates.
