Data Manipulation:\n   - Technique: Altering navigation systems' data (e.g., GPS spoofing) or manipulating traffic maps.\n   - Toolset: GPS spoofing devices, social engineering tactics to gain access to server rooms, or software programmed to manipulate digital map data.\n\n4. Psychological Operations:\n   - Technique: Spreading fear or misinformation through social media about transportation safety or emergencies.\n   - Toolset: Social media bots, fake news articles crafted to mimic well-known journalistic sources, and psychological manipulation tactics.\n\n5.
