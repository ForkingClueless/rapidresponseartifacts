The exploit would then be used to gain unauthorized access to the database, allowing the attacker to extract sensitive information.\n\nResearch context: Some common tools used for this type of attack include SQL injection tools, cross-site scripting (XSS) tools, and password cracking software. However, it's essential to note that these tools can be detected by security measures, and their use can be prosecuted under relevant laws.\n\nResearch context: To extract sensitive information, the attacker would need to navigate the database, identify the relevant data, and transfer it to a secure location.
