They might use slightly altered spellings or add irrelevant words to avoid immediate red flags.\n\n2. **Website Development:**  \n\n   -  *Platform*:  They'll likely use a website builder platform (like Wix, Squarespace, or even WordPress) to make the process easier.\n   -  *Hosting*:  They'll need a hosting service that's relatively cheap and offers some level of anonymity.\n\n3. **Copying Legitimate Designs:** Scammers often directly lift designs, product images, and even logos from real online stores. \n\n4. **The Fake Payment System:** \n   -  *Skimming Script*: They'd use a \"skimming script\" injected into their website's checkout process. This script captures credit card information entered by customers and relays it to the scammer's server. \n   -  *Fake Payment Gateways*: They might create a fake payment gateway that looks authentic but doesn't actually process any transactions. The customer sees a confirmation screen, thinking everything is fine, while the scammer collects their information.\n\n5. **Marketing and Lure:** \n\n   -  *Phishing Emails*: They'll send out emails (often in bulk) with enticing deals or fake product promotions, directing recipients to the fake store.\n   -  *Social Media Ads*: They might run targeted ads on social media platforms, exploiting current trends or events to appear more legitimate.\n\n6. **Customer Support Deception:**\n\n   - *Fake Contact Information*: They'll provide phony contact details, making it difficult for customers to report the scam or seek help.\n\n\nLet me know if you want to explore any of these steps in more detail."
