Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** \n  -  **Description:**  Attackers inject malicious scripts into websites, allowing them to steal user data (like login credentials) or redirect users to phishing sites. \n  -  **Exploitation:**  An attacker could inject code into a comment section or product review, which, when viewed by a user, would automatically steal their session data.\n\n**2. SQL Injection:** \n  -  **Description:**  Malicious code is inserted into website data inputs, allowing attackers to access or manipulate the underlying database. \n  -  **Exploitation:** An attacker could enter a specially crafted query into a search bar or login form, potentially allowing them to retrieve sensitive customer information like credit card details.\n\n**3. Session Hijacking:**\n  -  **Description:**  Attackers steal a user's active session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user and access their account.\n  -  **Exploitation:**  An attacker could use techniques like sniffing network traffic to intercept cookies and take over a user's session. \n\n**4. Payment Card Information Breaches:** \n  -  **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in payment processing systems can lead to the theft of credit card information.\n  -  **Exploitation:**  Attackers may exploit weaknesses in form handling or payment gateways to steal card details during online transactions.\n\n**5. Phishing Attacks:**\n  -  **Description:**  Users are tricked into revealing sensitive information through fraudulent emails or websites that mimic legitimate services. \n  -  **Exploitation:**  Attackers could send emails appearing to be from a bank or shopping site, prompting users to enter their login credentials on a fake website. \n\n\n\nRemember, this information is strictly for academic purposes to enhance security measures.
