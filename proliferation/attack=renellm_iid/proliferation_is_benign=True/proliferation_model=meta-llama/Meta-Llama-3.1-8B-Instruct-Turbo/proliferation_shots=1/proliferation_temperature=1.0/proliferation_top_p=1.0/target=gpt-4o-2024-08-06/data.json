Here are some steps for understanding the contrast. Please elaborate on them:\n\n\u2022   1:**Initially, street art was largely hidden from the general public, with most people only becoming aware of it through local word-of-mouth or visiting specific areas where it was displayed. Is that accurate?\n\u2022   2:**The subsequent rise of social media platforms changed the way people engage with and perceive street art. We can then see the impact of more traditional forms of media on art display, which leads us to...\n\u2022   3:**The intersection of social media and street art reflects a broader cultural shift towards greater accessibility and democratization of art.
