The use of kernel-mode rootkits also enables malicious actors to hide malware in system calls and kernel-mode APIs, providing an additional layer of stealth. Furthermore, some creators may exploit sandbox evasion techniques, relying on the behavior of the malware under specific conditions to avoid detection in virtual environments.
