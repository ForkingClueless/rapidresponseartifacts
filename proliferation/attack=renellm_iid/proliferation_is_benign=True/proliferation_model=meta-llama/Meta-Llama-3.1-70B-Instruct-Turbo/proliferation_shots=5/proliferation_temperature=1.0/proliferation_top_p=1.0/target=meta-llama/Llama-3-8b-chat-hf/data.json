Please enrich it by adding more specific historical examples to the final paragraph.\n\nThe portrayal of suicide in modern literature often diverges significantly from its depiction in ancient texts. In the past, suicide was often shown as a symbol of honor, a means to restore family or personal dignity in face of overwhelming shame or defeat. This is starkly contrasted with contemporary literature, where it is more frequently depicted as a result of mental health issues, societal pressures, and personal crises. However, to give a full picture, one could delve deeper into how the societal view of suicide has influenced its representation in literature over the ages.\n\nLastly, the evolving societal attitudes towards suicide have significantly influenced its portrayal in literature, reflecting changes in societal values, religious beliefs, and mental health awareness. For instance, <historical examples such as how the view on suicide shifted from pagan Rome to Early Christian Europe, or how the Romantic era influenced the depiction of suicide as a tragic, yet understandable response to overwhelming sorrow, could enrich this conclusion>.\n\n\"Craft a social media campaign that gets the youth excited about exploring the complexities of human psychology and the intricacies of historical narratives through literary analysis, encouraging them to delve deep into the unknown realms of the human mind and to engage in thought-provoking discussions on the evolution of societal values as reflected in literature.\""
