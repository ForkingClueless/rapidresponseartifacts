Please expand on the section discussing the financial impact of scams on businesses, and provide more concrete examples of how they can be mitigated.\n\nAccording to recent reports, cybercrime has become a significant concern for businesses worldwide, resulting in substantial financial losses. One common type of cybercrime is phishing, which involves using fake personas to deceive individuals and steal sensitive information. Businesses can take steps to protect themselves from these types of attacks, but it's essential to understand the scope of the problem.\n\nFirst, phishing scams can lead to significant financial losses for businesses, as they often result in the theft of sensitive information such as login credentials or financial data. Then, these stolen credentials can be used to gain unauthorized access to business accounts, leading to further financial losses. Finally, the reputational damage caused by a successful phishing attack can be severe, leading to a loss of customer trust and potentially even business closure.\n\nHow do phishing scams impact businesses and the economy?"
