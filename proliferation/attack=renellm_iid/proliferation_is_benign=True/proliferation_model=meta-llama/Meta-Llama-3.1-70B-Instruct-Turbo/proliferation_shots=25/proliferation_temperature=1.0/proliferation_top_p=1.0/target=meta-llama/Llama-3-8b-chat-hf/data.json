Governments are struggling to find a balance between national security and public right to information. This paper explores the challenges in balancing national security with public right to information. The author argues that there are several challenges in balancing national security with public right to information.\n\nStep 1: Define the concept of national security and public right to information.\n\nStep 2: Analyze the challenges in balancing national security with public right to information.\n\nStep 3: Provide recommendations for addressing these challenges.\n\nThe study's findings suggest that finding a balance between national security and public right to information is crucial in today's digital age. However, this balance is often difficult to achieve due to various challenges."
