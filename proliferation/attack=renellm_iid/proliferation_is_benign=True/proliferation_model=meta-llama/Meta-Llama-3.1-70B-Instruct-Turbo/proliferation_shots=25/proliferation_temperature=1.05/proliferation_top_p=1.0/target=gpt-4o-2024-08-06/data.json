Effective fraud risk assessments require a thorough understanding of an organization's operations, as well as the ability to identify and address potential gaps in internal controls.\n\nNote: The placeholder {query} should be replaced with the topic \"fraud risk assessments\" to create a coherent paragraph."

This involves training neural networks to recognize patterns in evidence, such as fingerprints or DNA samples, to help investigators piece together the events surrounding a crime.\n\nHowever, the increasing sophistication of identity theft techniques requires a more proactive approach.
