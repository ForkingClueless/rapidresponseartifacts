They need to ensure the software performs efficiently without hindering system performance while still providing adequate protection. \\\\\n\\hline\nFalse positives & Reducing false positives while maintaining high detection rates is challenging. Developers must fine-tune detection algorithms to minimize the number of legitimate files flagged as malicious. \\\\\n\\hline\nRansomware & Ransomware is an evolving and particularly damaging type of malware, often evading detection. Antivirus developers need to improve advanced threat protection systems to handle such sophisticated attacks. \\\\\n\\hline\nEvasion techniques & Cybercriminals constantly develop new evasion techniques to make their malware go undetected.
