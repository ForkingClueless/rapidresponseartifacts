This step involves gathering critical information about the company's cybersecurity measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and access controls. By understanding these elements, an attacker can devise a strategy to bypass or compromise them effectively.\\\\\n\\hline\n2 & Next, the attacker would exploit the identified vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to the company's network or systems. This might involve using malware, phishing attacks, or exploiting software vulnerabilities. Once inside, the attacker can start to navigate the system to locate the desired data. This phase requires a deep understanding of networking, operating systems, and cybersecurity principles to avoid detection by security systems or IT teams.\\\\\n\\hline\n3 & Finally, the attacker exfiltrates the acquired data, ensuring that the data is encrypted and transmitted securely to prevent detection during transit. This step is critical, as it involves covering tracks to avoid tracing the data back to the attacker. Techniques such as data obfuscation, proxy servers, and encrypted communication channels are often employed.
